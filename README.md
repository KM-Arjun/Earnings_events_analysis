# Earnings events: The Distribution of Moves

## Introduction 
We analyze the notable price fluctuations of publicly traded U.S. stocks coinciding with the announcement of quarterly earnings. Our focus is on understanding how these actual one-day returns correlate with the changes in option implied volatility. For three distinct years, we examine not only the direct (percentage) returns but also a forecasted scale of these returns. This forecast is based on the anticipated adjustments in implied volatility prior to the earnings announcements.
